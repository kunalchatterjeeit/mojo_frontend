                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
                                piece
                                of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard

                                a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more

                                Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                                word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                                sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good

                                Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                                popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                                amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
